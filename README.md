## This Repository is here to represent the Freelance Project - AutoXL for Ellcon Projects - that I am about to complete.

### This Repository will not contain any form of program source code that is used to Build the Final Product.

### This Repository is more like a proof of work that will confirm the creation of the project by me along with a Signed Certificate from the Ellcon Projects - Management.

### I participated in this freelance project as the Solo Fullstack Developer and take full responsibility of everything related to its development.

### I will be sharing some screenshots from the working app as well as the File Structures used for this Project, in this Repository.
